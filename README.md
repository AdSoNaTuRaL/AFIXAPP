# AFIXAPP
An application is being developed for people suffering from fibromyalgia. The idea was provided by the University of Ja√©n, in which I am doing a master's degree and attributed to me as a project of one of the master's subjects. The app is still in development.
It is important to note that until then I had no or little knowledge with Android development and this is a personal challenge for me.

## Application Features
1. A map area where the user can locate, search for places. Since it is common for a person suffering from this type of disease to have repeated forgetfulness;
2. An area where the application can provide information about physical exercises, relaxation exercises, audios, images and a series of other items so that the user who has this type of disease can feel more comfortable;
3. A task scheduler, reminders because this type of user has constant memory losses;
4. An area where the user can edit their profile and have more information about the disease and the association that sponsored the idea.
5. **[Here](https://marvelapp.com/47aidb5) you can find mokups of the screens**
